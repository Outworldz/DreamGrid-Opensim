The files in this archive are this text file, a terrain preview JPG (.jpg) file, a full terrain LLRAW (.raw) file and a full terrain RAW32 (.r32) file. If you are loading to a region larger than 256x256 it is best to use the .r32 file.

The preview JPG (.jpg) file shows a scaled image of the terrain, where blue is water and green is land, brighter the more elevated it is. If the terrain is larger than 256x256, the preview is covered by a red grid showing division into 256x256 panes,

Terrains larger than 256x256 may require the RAW32 (.r32) file, instead of the "usual" LLRAW (.raw) file, owing to a bug in at least some versions of OpenSimulator. Files can either be loaded through the sim console command, e.g. "terrain load example.raw" if the file "example.raw" is present in the OpenSim bin directory, or be uploaded via the OpenSimulator viewer's region/estate terrain controls. RAW32 (.r32) files can only be loaded through the sim console command.
